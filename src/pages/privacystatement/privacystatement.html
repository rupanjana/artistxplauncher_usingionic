This Privacy Policy only applies to the information collected, used and disclosed by ArtistXP Corp. and its affiliates (“ArtistXP” “we” “us” or “our”) or any third parties acting with our authorization or otherwise provided to us by third parties about you, in each instance, with respect to your access to and use of the Services, whether as an Artist, Fan, visitor or user, and whether offline or online, through (a) your interaction with our products and services, (b) our website, located at www.artistxp.com and all corresponding web pages and websites owned or operated by ArtistXP, including www.audiodeadline.com (the “Sites”), (c) the ArtistXP-branded mobile, web, tablet, desktop and other applications, including applications made available through iOS and Android (the “ArtistXP App(s)”) or (d) any of the Content, ArtistXP’s social networking services and any other content, applications, features, functionality, information and services offered by us whether through the ArtistXP Apps, the Sites or otherwise (each of the above individually and collectively referred to herein as the “Services”).

If you’d like to utilize the Services for purchasing tickets (e.g., to view an Audio Deadline Live Streaming Event) or other transaction, you may then be asked to provide your credit card information. When purchasing tickets, you may be pushed to a third-party website that allows you enter your credit card and billing information and complete the purchase transaction. We do not keep or process your credit card or billing information. "
