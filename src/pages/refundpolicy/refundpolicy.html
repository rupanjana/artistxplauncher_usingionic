        "We may make available certain fee-based content and other e-commerce services on and/or in connection with the Services or through third party service providers (“Fee-Based Services”). For example, you may be able to purchase tickets to Audio Deadline live streaming events (“Live Streaming Events”) and certain music-related products and/or services through the Services or third party service providers, including additional Services features and functionality. You acknowledge and agree that certain Fee-Based Services may utilize third party service providers, and all purchases made through these third party service providers are subject to their respective terms and conditions, and in the event of a conflict between such third party’s terms and conditions and this Agreement, the terms and conditions of the third party service provider shall govern and control. ArtistXP is not responsible and has no liability whatsoever for goods or services you obtain through our third party service providers or other web sites or web pages. We encourage you to make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online transaction with any of these third parties. "

        " You may only use the Fee-Based Services if, and you hereby represent, warrant and agree that, (a) you are 18 years of age or older and a legal resident of the United States of America (“U.S.”) and (b) you shall pay in full the prices and fees (including all applicable taxes) for any purchases you, or anyone using the User Account registered to you, make via PayPal, credit, debit or charge card or other payment means then acceptable to ArtistXP concurrent with your order. Certain payment means acceptable to ArtistXP may be subject to certain additional restrictions and conditions, including territory restrictions, bank/payment card restrictions, spending limits, third party service provider restrictions or otherwise, which may prevent the processing of your order. If a transaction has been declined online due to payment card or other payment service issues, please ensure all data is correct and resubmit. If the transaction is not accepted, you will be unable to use that card or payment method for your transaction and should use another card or payment method acceptable to ArtistXP and/or third party service providers, as applicable.
